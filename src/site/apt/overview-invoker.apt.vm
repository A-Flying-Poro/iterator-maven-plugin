Iterator Maven Plugin


* Overview

  The <{{{./invoker-mojo.html}invoker}}> goal is intended to call a separate instance of Maven during your
  current Maven build. This is more or less equivalent to call maven from command line separately but
  with the help of Maven itself.


* Different Working Directory

  You can change the working directory for the Maven call by using:

+------
<executions>
  <execution>
    <phase>package</phase>
    <goals>
      <goal>invoker</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
      <items>
        <item>one</item>
        <item>two</item>
        <item>three</item>
      </items>
      <workingDirectory>configurations/@item@</workingDirectory>
      <goals>
        <goal>clean</goal>
        <goal>package</goal>
      </goals>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
+------


* Different Base Directory

  You can change the base directory directory for the Maven call by using:

+------
<executions>
  <execution>
    <phase>package</phase>
    <goals>
      <goal>invoker</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
      <items>
        <item>one</item>
        <item>two</item>
        <item>three</item>
      </items>
      <baseDirectory>folder/@item@</baseDirectory>
      <goals>
        <goal>clean</goal>
        <goal>package</goal>
      </goals>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
+------


* Different goal

  You can change the goal for the Maven call by using:

+------
<executions>
  <execution>
    <phase>package</phase>
    <goals>
      <goal>invoker</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
      <items>
        <item>one</item>
        <item>two</item>
        <item>three</item>
      </items>
      <goals>plugin-name:@item@<goals>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
+------

* Different Profiles

  You can change the profile for the Maven call by using:

+------
<executions>
  <execution>
    <phase>package</phase>
    <goals>
      <goal>invoker</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
      <items>
        <item>one</item>
        <item>two</item>
        <item>three</item>
      </items>
      <profiles>@item@<profiles>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
+------


~~        // Profiles:
~~        // mvn -Pxyz-@item@ clean package
~~        // mvn -P@item@
~~        request.setProfiles(getProfilesAfterPlaceHolderIsReplaced(currentValue));
~~ 
~~        // Projects:
~~        // mvn -pl xyz-@item@ clean package
~~        request.setProjects(getProjectsAfterPlaceHolderIsReplaced(currentValue));
