Iterator Executor Invoker Maven Plugin


  The basic idea behind this plugin is to make iterations over a list of values possible. This 
  means having a list of values like this: <<<one, two, three>>> and execute an other plugin or
  an Maven instance and give the current value as a parameter to the plugin or to the Maven call.

* Goals Overview

  There are currently two goals <{{{./executor-mojo.html}executor}}> which is able to
  call a plugin during the usual run of Maven and the 
  <{{{./invoker-mojo.html}invoker}}> goal which will call Maven like you have called 
  Maven separately on command line. 
  
* Usage

  The itexin-maven-plugin can be bound to any {{{http://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/lifecycles.html}lifecycle phase}}
  as you like.
