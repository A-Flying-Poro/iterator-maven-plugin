Iterator Maven Plugin


* Using Folder

  The iterator-maven-plugin can be used to iterate over folders which might be helpful
  in some situations cause it's dynamic and not fixed in the pom file.

├── main
│   ├── java
│   │   └── com
│   │       └── soebes
│   │           └── maven
│   │               └── multiple
│   │                   ├── first
│   │                   ├── second
│   │                   └── third

+-----

  Let us think you would like to iterate over the folders <first>, <second> and <third>.
  
%{include|source=target/it/directoryIteratorTest/pom.xml|snippet=#start}

  During the execution the values for item will be <first>, <second> and <third>.
