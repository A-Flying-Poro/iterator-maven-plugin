Usage

   Lets assume you would like to call the 
   {{{http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22maven-echo-plugin%22}maven-echo-plugin}} 
   several times. Apart form being really useful it's for an example. 
   This can be achieved by the following:
   
%{include|source=target/it/outputWithoutDebugTest/pom.xml|snippet=#start}

   This will produce the following output during a <<<mvn clean package>>> call
   which will show you the messages produced by the 
   {{{http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22maven-echo-plugin%22}maven-echo-plugin}} 
   and their appropriate values.

%{include|source=target/it/outputWithoutDebugTest/build-filtered.log|highlight-type=text}

  []
